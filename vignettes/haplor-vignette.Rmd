## Overview

HaploReg (<https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php>) [@Ward_2011], 
RegulomeDB (<http://www.regulomedb.org>) [@Boyle_2012], and
LDlink (<https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/>) [@Machiela_2015]
are web-based tools that extract biological information such as eQTL, 
LD, LD matrices, motifs, etc. from large genomic projects such as ENCODE, 
the 1000 Genomes Project, Roadmap Epigenomics Project and others. 
This is sometimes called "post stage GWAS" analysis.

The R-package _haploR_ was developed to query 
those tools (HaploReg, RegulomeDB, LDlink) directly from 
_R_ in order to facilitate high-throughput 
genomic data analysis. Below we provide several examples 
that show how to work with this package.

Note: you must have a stable Internet connection 
to use this package.

Contact: <ilya.zhbannikov@duke.edu> for questions of 
usage the _haploR_ or any other issues.

### Motivation and typical analysis workflow

This package was inspired by the fact that many web-based post stage GWAS databases do not have Application Programing Interface (API) and, therefore, do not allow users to query them remotedly from R environment. In our research we used HaploReg and RegulomeDB web databases. These very useful web databases show information about linkage disequilibrium of query variants and variants which are in LD with them, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), motifs changed and other useful information. However, it is not easy to include this information into streamlined workflow since those tools also not offer API.

We developed a custom analysis pipeline which prepares data, performs genome-wide association (GWA) analysis and presents results in a user-friendly format. Results include a list of genetic variants (also known as 'SNP' or single nucleotide polymorphism), their corresponding _p_-values, phenotypes (traits) tested and other meta-information such as LD, alternative allele, minor allele frequency, motifs changed, etc. Of course, we could go throught the list of SNPs having genome-wide significant _p_-values (1e-8) and submit each of those SNPs to web-based tools manually, one-by-one, but it is time-consuming process and will not be fully automatic (which ruins one of the pipeline's paradigms). This is especially difficult if the web site does not offer downloading results.

Therefore, we developed _haploR_, a user-friendly R package that connects to the web tool from R environment with methods POST/GET and downloads results in a suitable R format. This package siginificantly saved our time in developing reporting system for our internal genomic analysis pipeline and now we would like to present _haploR_ to the research community.

Example of typical analysis workflow is shown below.

![Typical analysis workflow](Workflow.png)

* Data preprocessing stage usually consists of basic cleaning operations (sex inconsistencies check, filtering by MAF, missing genotype rate), format conversion, population stratification, creating temporaty files, etc.
* Genome-wide association study (GWAS). This Includes testing hyphotesis on correlation between phenotype and genotype. Usually in form of linear or logistic regression but can be quite sophisticated especially for rare variants.
* Postprocessing usually includes summarizing results in tables, creating graphics (Manhattan plot, QQ-plot), sometimes filtering by significance threshold (usually 1E-8), removing temporary files, etc.
* Post stage GWAS analysis: connect GWAS findings with existing studies and gather information about linked SNPs, chromatin state, protein binding annotation, sequence conservation across mammals, effects on regulatory motifs and on gene expression, etc. This helps researchers to more understand functions and test additional hyphotesis of found genome-wide significant SNPs. At this stage _haploR_ is especially useful because it provides a convenient R interface to mining web databases. This, in turn, streamlines analysis workflow and therefore significantly reduces analysis time. Previously researchers had to do it manually after analysis by exploring available web resources, checking each SNP of interest and downloading results (which is especially painful if website does not have a download option). With _haploR_ such post-GWAS information are easily retrieved, shared and appeared in the final output tables at the end of analysis. This will save researchers' time.

## Installation of _haploR_ package

In order to install the _haploR_ package, the user must first install R (<https://www.r-project.org>). After that, _haploR_ can be installed either:

* From CRAN (stable version):

install.packages("haploR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

* Or from the package web page (developing version):

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("izhbannikov/haplor")
```


_haploR_ depends on the following packages: 

* _httr_, version 1.2.1 or later.
* _XML_, version version 3.98-1.6 or later.
* _tibble_, version 1.3.0 or later.

Number of rows is not constant, at least equal or more than the number of query SNPs, and depends on _r2_ parameter choosen in a query (default 0.8). This means that the program outputs not only query SNPs, but also those SNPs that have _r2_ $\geq$ 0.8 with the query SNPs.

#### One or several genetic variants

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(haploR)
x <- queryHaploreg(query=c("rs10048158","rs4791078"))
x
```

Here _query_ is a vector with names of genetic variants. 

We then can create a subset from the results, for example, to choose only SNPs with r2 $>$ 0.9:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
subset.high.LD <- x[as.numeric(x$r2) > 0.9, c("rsID", "r2", "chr", "pos_hg38", "is_query_snp", "ref", "alt")]
subset.high.LD
```

We can then save the _subset.high.LD_ into an Excel workbook:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
require(openxlsx)
write.xlsx(x=subset.high.LD, file="subset.high.LD.xlsx")
```


This was an example of gathering post-gwas information directly from the online tool. _haploR_ has an additional advantage because it downloads the full information for query retrieved by HaploReg. For example, if you go online and submit these two SNPs to HaploReg (<https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php>), you will see that some cells of columns "Motifs changed" and "Selected eQTL hits" are hidded (only number of hits are given). _haploR_ retrives this information in a form of a data frame which can be saved into Excel file.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
x[, c("Motifs", "rsID")]
x[, c("eQTL", "rsID")]
```

#### Uploading file with variants

If you have a file with your SNPs you would like 
to analyze, you can 
supply it as an input as follows:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(haploR)
x <- queryHaploreg(file=system.file("extdata/snps.txt", package = "haploR"))
x
```

File "snps.txt" is a text file which contains one rs-ID per line:

```
rs10048158
rs4791078
```

#### Using existing studies

Sometimes one would like to explore results from 
already performed study. In this case you should 
first explore the existing studies from 
HaploReg web site (<https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php>) and then use one of 
them as an input parameter. See example below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(haploR)
# Getting a list of existing studies:
studies <- getStudyList()
# Let us look at the first element:
studies[[1]]
# Let us look at the second element:
studies[[2]]
# Query Hploreg to explore results from 
# this study:
x <- queryHaploreg(study=studies[[1]])
x
```

#### Extended view of SNP

If you want to see more information about SNP of interest, you can use the ```getExtendedView```:
Parameters:
*```snp``` - A SNP of interest.
*```url``` - A url to the HaploReg. Default: "https://pubs.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/detail_v4.1.php?query=&id="

Return A list of tables ```t1```, ```t2```, ..., etc, depending on information contained in HaploReg database.

Example:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(haploR)
tables <- getExtendedView(snp="rs10048158")
tables
```

### Querying RegulomeDB

To query RegulomeDB use this function:
```
queryRegulome(query = NULL, 
              format = "full",
              url = "http://www.regulomedb.org/results", 
              timeout = 10,
              check_bad_snps = TRUE, 
              verbose = FALSE)
```

This function queries RegulomeDB <http://www.regulomedb.org> web-based tool and returns results in a named list.

#### Arguments

* _query_: Query (a vector of rsIDs).
* _format_: An output format.  Only 'full' is currently supported. See ```http://www.regulomedb.org/results```. Can be on of the following: ```full``` - plain text, ```bed``` -  BED (Browser Extensible Data) format, see e.g. <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format5.1>, ```gff``` - GFF (General Feature Format), see e.g. <https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format3>. Only ```full``` is currently supported. 
* _url_: Regulome url address.  Default: ```http://www.regulomedb.org/results```
* _timeout_: A 'timeout' parameter for 'curl'. Default: 10.
* _check_bad_snps_: Checks if all query SNPs are annotated (i.e. presented in the Regulome Database). Default: 'TRUE'
* _verbose_: Verbosing output. Default: FALSE.

#### Output

A list of two: (1) a data frame (res.table) wrapped to a _tibble_ object and (2) a list of bad SNP IDs (bad.snp.id).  Bad SNP ID are those IDs that were not found in 1000 Genomes Phase 1 data and, therefore, in RegulomeDB.

Columns in a data frame (res.table):

* _#chromosome_: Chromosome. Type: character.
* _coordinate_: Position. Type: numeric.
* _rsid_: RefSeq SNP ID. Type: character.
* _hits_: Contains information about chromatin structure: method and cell type. Type: character.
* _score_: Internal RegulomeDB score. See <http://www.regulomedb.org/help#score>. Type: numeric.

Number of rows is equal or less (in case if not all SNPs were found in RegulomeDB database) to number of query SNPs.

All the information retreived from RegulomeDB, except _hits_, are also presented in HaploReg output (```queryHaploReg(...)```).

#### Example

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(haploR)
x <- queryRegulome(c("rs4791078","rs10048158"))
x$res.table
x$bad.snp.id
```


### Querying LDlink

_LDlink_ (<https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/>) is a set of web-based tools that allow exloring Linkage Disequilibrium of provided set of SNPs. _LDlink_ allows for the following tools:

* _LDassoc_
* _LDhap_
* _LDmatrix_
* _LDpair_
* _LDproxy_
* _SNPchip_
* _SNPclip_

Currently _haploR_ supports _LDmatrix_ only but we are currently working on adding other tools from _LDlink_ project.

#### LDmatrix
Function 
```
LDlink.LDmatrix(snps, r2d = "r2", population = "ALL")
```

This function queries HaploReg web-based tool and returns results.

##### Arguments

* _snps_:	A list of snps (a vector of rsIDs, or a file, one SNP per line).
* _population_:	A particular population. Default: ```ALL```.

##### Value

A list of two: (1) raw LD r2 matrix, (2) raw LD D-prime matrix.

##### Example

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(haploR)
ldmat <- LDlink.LDmatrix(snps=c("rs77264218", "rs11229158", "rs10896659", "rs10896702", "rs2042592"), population="AFR")
ldmat
# Stylish matrix R2
stylish.matrix.r2 <- makeStylishLDmatrix(ldmat$matrix.r2)
stylish.matrix.r2
# Stylish matrix D'
stylish.matrix.Dprime <- makeStylishLDmatrix(ldmat$matrix.dprime)
stylish.matrix.Dprime
```
